## Tech Blog

In this case we wanted to be able to create a Blog where people can come and share their thoughts and ideas as it pertains to all things tech. The idea is for the user, upon opening the page will see existing blog entries, with navigation links to the homepage. Upon clicking to the homepage, the user is prompted to sign in or sign up. Those credentials are logged to the site. The user from there can create new blog posts, or read past entries. 


This project will build upon knowledge of MVC. (Model, view, controller) which incorparates past lessons with handlebars that dynamically connect HTML pages to enhance the user experience.
